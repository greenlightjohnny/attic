  Angels in the Attic began with a seed of an idea from its founder Kathy
  Blackwell. Kathy provided countless hours over the years she served as
  director, making Angels a true ministry while helping the people of Floyd
  County. Opening in March of 2000, Angels in the Attic operated in two
  different locations before finding the “forever home” at 201 South Locust
  Street in 2002. This building, near the center of the Town of Floyd, Virginia,
  was paid off in 14 months with fundraisers and community support. Mid 2011,
  the Angels Boutique was opened. This adjacent retail space was created to sell
  the many donations that were new, unique, vintage, collectible, and even
  re-purposed. Dealers are welcome to purchase these items. Also in 2011, a
  house with outbuildings and acreage was purchased that was located only a
  quarter mile away from downtown at 112 Needmore Lane in Floyd. This property
  is used as the Donation Center. This facility is convenient for the community
  to drop off their donated goods and is open seven days a week. Volunteers at
  the donation center sort, box, label and deliver donations to the stores.
donations: Honoring Donations

  Angels is committed to honoring the gift of each donation by restocking gently
  used, like new and new items each day of operation. Every effort is made to
  ensure donations are first available for sale in Angels in the Attic stores
  and then shared with other not-for-profit human service agencies such as the
  Rescue Mission, Salvation Army and Goodwill.
